## Introduction

The Bouncing Ball Animation is a simple Java Swing application that demonstrates a bouncing ball within a frame. The ball undergoes transformations, including changing its shape to an oval upon collision with the frame edges. The application utilizes threads to manage the transformation process, allowing for smooth animation without freezing the user interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with "Bouncing Ball Animation", follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Java:** Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Bouncing-Ball
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Bouncing-Ball
```
3. Compile and run the game using the following command:
```
javac Bouncing-Ball.java && java Bouncing-Ball
```

## Features

- **Bouncing Ball Animation:** The program features a ball that moves within a frame and bounces off the edges.
- **Shape Transformation:** Upon collision with the frame edges, the ball transforms into an oval shape, providing an interesting visual effect.
- **Multithreading:** The application uses threads to handle the oval transformation independently, ensuring smooth animation without affecting the main UI thread.
- **Dynamic Collision Handling:** The ball changes its direction upon colliding with the frame edges, creating a continuous bouncing effect.
